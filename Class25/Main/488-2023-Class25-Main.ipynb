Which one works best for your specific purpose (i.e., classifcation of sentences from hotel reviews) depends on many factors (e.g., which data a model was pre-trained on, how big its vocabulary is, how advanced its architecture is, etc.). \n","1. Try using BERT cased and see what happens\n","2. Try a different model like RoBERTa\n","3. If you are working with Tweets, consider BERTweet\n","\n","## How to improve the model's performance 2: **Label more Sentences**\n","In many cases you can improve the performance of your classifier by giving it more data to train on. You might pursue two objectives: First, help you classifier more accurately predict sentences that are difficult to predict. Second, add more variation in sentence content and structure to your training sample. You might proceed as follows:\n","1. Train a classifier\n","2. Investigate which sentences of your training are misclassified\n","3. Embed those sentences with the SentenceBERT (Class24). \n","4. Search for similar (embedded) sentences in a large pool of sentence candiates (see Class 24). \n","5. Label these sentences and add them to your sample.\n","6. Train-Test-Split, train the classifier (on train) and evaluate (on test).\n","7. Repeat 2-6 as needed until you are satisfied.\n","8. ***How could ChatGPT help you?***\n","\n","\n","## How to improve the model's performance 3: Try **Active Learning**\n","In active learning, we build the sample on which we train our classifier up step-by-step instead of all at once.\n","1. Start with a small, balanced sample of labeled data (maybe 200 sentences)\n","2. Train a classifier\n","3. Use the classifier to predict new sentences (maybe 3000)\n","  - Check for which sentences the classifier is \"most uncertain\", that is, where the scores or probabilites are lowest. In other words, where the predicitons are closest to the decision boundaries between classes. \n","4. Label the N most uncertain sentences (e.g., 50), remove them from the pool of unlabeled sentences, and add them to your sample\n","5. Repeat steps 2-4 (e.g., now with 250 sentences = original + 50) and track how model performance improves.\n","6. Repeat steps 2-5 until the improvement of your model's performance becomes marginal.\n","\n","## *To get a truly great classifier, you'd probably need to combine all of the above!*"],"metadata":{"id":"eAAqchLtkbzA"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# You just added another ***super powerful tool*** to your Data Science Toolbox! \n","\n","## ***Use it for your Major Class Project on ToothPaste!***"],"metadata":{"id":"CK7-2oD6nmqX"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#**Looking Ahead:**  \n","\n","####***Next Class:*** *Tuesday, April 25, 2023*\n","#### **Review with Q&A and Course Wrap-up**\n","  - I'll summarize your journey through the data science pipeline\n","  - **Bring Questions to class** I can only answer questions if you ask them.\n","  - When all questions are asked, we will use the remaining time for team-work\n","\n","**BONUS Assignments** due before midnight 4/20.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"aYMwQXt8He_z"}}]}
