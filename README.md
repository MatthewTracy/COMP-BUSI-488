# COMP-BUSI-488 Course Repository

Hello! This is my COMP / BUSI 488 lecture repo taught by Daniel Ringel at UNC-Chapel Hill.

This was one of my favorite classes I ever took at UNC! The hands-on approach to data science made it extremely fun and interesting. One highlight of this course was the opportunity to collaborate with a diverse group of peers, ranging from undergraduates to master's students. We worked on several projects where we applied ensemble supervised models and utilized pre-trained LLMs, enhancing our understanding and skills in data science. I learned about Data Wrangling, Unsupervised Learning, Supervised Learning, & Natural Language Processing.
