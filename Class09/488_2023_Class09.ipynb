Team Assignment 2: Helping a local Coffee Shop with Data Science\n","\n","In Assignment 2, we give you some real data from a local coffee shop that was hit by the pandemic.  To facilitate your analysis, here are some ideas for wrangling this data: looking at dates, looking at what features are available, cleaning up the coding of dollar amounts, calculating prices and price modifiers, cleaning item names, and recategorizing.  \n","\n","Remember that it is important to **begin with a question**, because that will determine where to spend your efforts.  Here are some paragraphs from the assignment text with possible questions, and you will be able to think of others.  After some exploration, **focus on one question** that you can state as a complete sentence.  All of your wrangling and analysis should be in support of that question -- you needn't clean data items that you are going to drop or recategorize.  \n","\n","### Your Task:\n","Your team’s task is to analyze the cashier's log data and develop recommendations that would make the coffee shop business more profitable. There are multiple aspects you could think about such as finance, marketing and/or operations. The choice is yours.\n","\n","### Remarks:\n","It may be helpful to augment the limited data you are provided with additional data from other data sources to create deeper insights that allow for better recommendations. For instance: \n","* Could the weather drive sales? \n","* How much does staff really cost and how much do you really need?\n","* What about COGS (cost of goods sold)? \n","* Can they bundle products? Upsell? \n","* What price should they charge for their products? \n","* Could they be more profitable with fewer SKUs? What about advertising and promotion? \n","* Would an investment into equipment or another location make sense (provided they can get a loan)? \n","\n","***These questions are just examples and possible avenues of analysis.
